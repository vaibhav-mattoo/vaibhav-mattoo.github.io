## What are the 802 standards?
- The IEEE 802 standards are some network specifications developed to govern LANs, MANs and PANs, to allow interoperability across many networking devices from different manufacturers.
### 802 Architecture in OSI model
- These standards define protocols for the physical and data link layers of the OSI model, to provide unified framework for wired and wireless technologies.
- Here the data link layer is subdivided into:
  - **Logical Link Control (LLC)**: Manages frame synchronization and error checking.
  - **Media Access Control (MAC)**: Handles addressing, collision detection, and channel access.

  | OSI Layer        | IEEE 802 Subdivisions         | Example Standards          |
  |-------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
  | Data Link Layer   | LLC (802.2)                   | Ethernet (802.3), Wi-Fi (802.11) |
  |                   | MAC                           | Bluetooth (802.15.1)       |
  | Physical Layer    | PHY Specifications            | Fiber optics (802.8)       |

## What is a 802.11 nickname?

- The access point broadcasts its network name as a SSID (Service Set Identifier)
- The 802.11 nickname is a client side identifier that is transmitted suring WiFi connection establishment in management frames for:
  - **Probe requests** : Sent by clients to discover nearby networks.
  - **Authentication Frames** : Used during authentication handshakes.
  - **Association Request Frames** : These are sent to join a network.
- These management frames are sent without encryption so this nickname is exposed to anyone monitoring.
- The 802.11 frame header consists of four address fields with MAC addresses for receiver and transmitted but the 802.11 nickname is not part of the header field but is in the frame body of these management frames, often in:
  - Vendor Specific Information Elements (IEs) : Custom fields added by driver/OS implementations.
    - The general format of an IE consists of a 1-octet Element ID field, a 1-octet Length field (specifies number of octets after this length field), an optional 1-octet Element ID Extension field, and a variable length information field.
  - Non standard extensions to the 802.11 specification.

## How to prevent revealing hostname to the Access Point?
- First, while setting up your computer, make sure to use a hostname which is not obviously tracable to you.
- In linux, first get the wireless_tools package with `sudo pacman -S wireless_tools` if you dont have it since iwconfig is deprecated.
- Then use the command: 
```bash
sudo iwconfig wlan0 nickname "Fucko The Clown"
```
> The iwconfig nickname command relies on Wireless Extensions (WEXT), a deprecated API for Linux wireless drivers. Most modern drivers no longer support this feature since it is not really required for network operation so on a new system you will get an error on running the command above.
{: .prompt-info }

- Workaround for new systems:
```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname "generic-name"
```
- Since the nickname defaults to the hostname we need to rename the machine, then reboot for the changes to take effect.
